# Note Flow

Note Flow is a react based Text Editor that is specifically geared towards Computer Science and Math note-taking. This text editor allows you to easily format code, use code snippets, syntax highlighting and insert math equations. The editor also allows you to embed links and graphs such as flowcharts, tables, and UML diagrams.

## Getting Started
The project is still under development, but in a few weeks it will be hosted via Github Pages or deployed on Heroku.
